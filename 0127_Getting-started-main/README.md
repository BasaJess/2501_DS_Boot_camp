Becoming a Data Scientist starts with setting up the right working environment. 

There are two folder in this repo. They are both setting up you macbook. In [setup-with-just](setup-with-just) you will find a script that does all the work for you. In [setup-without-just](setup-without-just) you will find detailed instructions on how to do it yourself.

We will use the script that does the job for you but if you want to look up every step you can look into the more detailed instructions.

There is another markdown file with instructions on how to [install and setup VS Code](VSCode_setup.md). It also contains useful information on how to deal with virtual environments in VS Code.
