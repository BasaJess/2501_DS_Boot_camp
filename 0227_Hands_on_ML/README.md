# Hands on Machine Learning

This repo contains notebooks explaining different machine learning techniques every Data Scientist should know. 

Notebook [Scaling & Hyperparameter Tuning](1_Scaling_Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb) will show you two different ways to scale your data and tune the hyperparameter of your models. Furthermore it will introduce the concept of cross-validation. 

In the notebook [Exercise_Machine_Learning](2_Exercise_Machine_Learning.ipynb) you will have the chance to practice what you have seen in the previous notebooks, but first you will need to download the data from the database.

In the BONUS notebook [Feature_engineering]
(3_BONUS_Feature_Engineering.ipynb) you will have an example of the most common FE and their usage (imputation, OHE, binning, scaling, feature creation)


## Set up your Environment

Please make sure you have forked the repo and set up a new virtual environment. For this purpose you can use the following commands:

The added [requirements file](requirements.txt) contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute the hands-on ml notebooks.

*Note: If there are errors during environment setup, try removing the versions from the failing packages in the requirements file. M1 shizzle.*

### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 


- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-Bash` CLI :

  ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

The data used in this notebook is saved in a `.zip` file. To unzip it, copy the block below into your terminal:

```Bash
unzip data.zip
