# Intro to NLP

In this repo we will have a look at various topics related to NLP.

### The way to success:

Please work in pairs through all the notebooks in this particular order:

1. [Spam Classifier](1_Spam_Classifier.ipynb)
2. [Zero Shot Learning](2_Spam_Zero_Shot.ipynb)
3. [Transformer Pipeline Models](3_Transformers_Zero_Shot_Pipeline.ipynb)
4. [Create Embeddings](4_create_embeddings.ipynb)
5. [Optional](5_Optional.ipynb)


- In the first notebook you will do basic text processing and train a model to classify spam.
- In the second notebook you will use a pretrained network from the Transformers library and do Zero Shot Learning to predict spam.
- In the third notebook you will see the different models which can be used for different tasks.
- In the fourth notebook you will see how the embeddings are created for a neural network model.


## Set up your Environment

Please make sure you have forked the repo and set up a new virtual environment.

The added [requirements file](requirements.txt) contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute the NLP notebooks.

**`Note:`**

- If there are errors during environment setup, try removing the versions from the failing packages in the requirements file. silicon shizzle.
- In some cases it is necessary to install the **Rust** compiler for the transformers library.
- make sure to install **hdf5** if you haven't done it before.

 - Check the **rustup version**  by run the following commands:
    ```sh
    rustup --version
    ```
    If you haven't installed it yet, begin at `step_1`. Otherwise, proceed to `step_2`.


### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 

- `Step_1:` Update Homebrew and install **rustup** and **hdf5** by following commands:

    ```BASH
    brew install rustup
    rustup-init
    ```
    Then press ```1``` for the standard installation.
    
    Then we can go on to install hdf5:
    
    ```BASH
     brew install hdf5
    ```

  Restart Your Terminal and then check the **rustup version**  by running the following commands:
     ```sh
    rustup --version
    ```
 
- `Step_2:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

  > NOTE: for macOS with **silicon** chips (other than intel)
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements_silicon.txt
    ```
  > NOTE: for macOS with **intel** chips
  ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- `Step_1:` Install **rustup**  by following :
  
  1. Visit the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
  2. Download and run the `rustup-init.exe` installer.
  3. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose the default options for a standard installation.
  4. Then press ```1``` for the standard installation.
 
     
    Then we can go on to install hdf5:

    ```sh
     choco upgrade chocolatey
     choco install hdf5
    ```
    Restart Your Terminal and then check the **rustup version**  by running the following commands:
  
     ```sh
    rustup --version
    ```

- `Step_2:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
