    "Using the KNN algorithm from scikit-learn is quite simple. When you use it, you don't even need to know how KNN works and classifies the data points. The goal should be to really understand what you are doing. This is the only way to make sure you understand when something doesn't go the way you expect or want it to. Many people remember things best when they implement them themselves. So, let's build our own K-Nearest-Neighbors classifier!\n",

    "\n",
    "You have already implemented a function to calculate the distance between points, which will now come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started, is to ignore the syntax and just write in simple text what you want your program to do aka **write pseudocode**. You can then start to build out some of the structure. What variables are you going to need? What kinds of logic? \n",
    "Knowing where you’re going can help you make fewer mistakes as you’re trying to get there.\n",

    "## Distance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "As already explained, KNN assigns a class to the test point based on the majority class of  K  nearest neighbors. In general, euclidean distance is used to find nearest neighbors, but other distance metrics can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the dimensionality of the feature space increases, the euclidean distance often becomes problematic due to the curse of dimensionality (discussed later).\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, alternative vector-based similarity measures (dot product, cosine similarity, etc) are used to find the nearest neighbors. This transforms the original metric space into one more amicable to point-to-point measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another distance measure that you might consider is [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance). Mahalanobis distance attempts to weight features according to their probabilities. On some data sets that may be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's probably a good idea to normalize the data at a minimum. Here's a link to the scikit-learn scaling package: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html . You have to be a little circumspect about employing any technique where the answers change with scaling."
