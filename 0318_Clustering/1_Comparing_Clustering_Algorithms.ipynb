    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of K-Means is simple: group similar data points together to a fixed number (*k*) of clusters. Besides the data the only thing the algorithm needs as an input is the number of clusters *k*. *K* in this case can also be seen as the number of centroids, with a centroid being the imaginary or real location representing the cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimize the **inertia**, or **within-cluster sum of squared criterion**:\n",

    "$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\min_{\\mu_j \\in C}(||x_i - \\mu_j||^2)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Each centroid defines one of the clusters. In this step, each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, based on the squared Euclidean distance. More formally, if $c_i$ is the collection of centroids in set $C$, then each data point $x$ is assigned to a cluster based on\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Centroid update       \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, the centroids are recomputed. This is done by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid's cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convergence and random initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Given enough time this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a result. The result may be a local minimum (i.e. not necessarily the best possible outcome), meaning that assessing more than one run of the algorithm with randomized starting centroids may give a better outcome."

Computing the similarity (e.g. distance) between each cluster the two most similar clusters will be joined. Finally, repeating the steps over and over results in one big cluster and a cluster hierarchy. Once you have a cluster hierarchy you can choose a level or cut (according to some criteria) and take the clusters at that level of the tree. For `sklearn` we usually choose a cut based on a `n_clusters` parameter passed in.\n",
