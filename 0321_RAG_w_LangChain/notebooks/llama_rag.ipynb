      "ReAct is a framework that augments an agent's action space to include language-based actions, which it calls \"thoughts\" or \"reasoning traces\". These thoughts do not affect the external environment, but instead aim to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context. ReAct allows the agent to update its context and support future reasoning or acting. The framework shows strong generalization to new task instances and is robust to prompt selections, and also promises an interpretable sequential decision-making and reasoning process. Additionally, humans can control or correct the agent's behavior on the go by editing its thoughts.\n"
